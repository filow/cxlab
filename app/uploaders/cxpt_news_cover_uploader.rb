  storage :file
  # storage :fog

  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:

  # def default_url

  # Process files as they are uploaded:
  process :resize_to_fill => [569, 300]
  #
  # def scale(width, height)
  #   # do something
  # end

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  version :thumb do
    process :resize_to_fill => [280, 147]
  end
  version :index_thumb,:from_version=> :thumb do
    process :resize_to_fill => [200, 105]

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_white_list
    %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
  end

  # Override the filename of the uploaded files:
  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
